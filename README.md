## Project 5: Super Duo
This is a project for Udacity's [Android Developers Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

This project specifically tests the knowleged learnt in the course [Advanced Android App Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).

### Starting Code
Here is the [starting code](https://www.udacity.com/api/nodes/4276988636/supplemental_media/football-scores-startingzip/download) for this project.

### Project Description
> #### Project Overview
> You will productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

> #### Why this Project?

> Super Duo gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

> Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

> #### What Will I Learn?

> In this project, you will:

> - Diagnose existing issues with an app.
> - Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
> - Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
> - Handle error cases in Android.
> - Add a widget to your app experience.
> - Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.

> #### User Feedback for Alexandria:

> Lauren says:
> “I like this app generally, and the speed at which books come up on my phone after I enter the ISBN is awesome. I’m frustrated that the scanning functionality isn’t implemented yet. That would speed up the whole process and make the app way more useful for me.”

> Josh says:
> “This app is terrible. They say you can scan books, but that functionality isn’t in the app yet. It also crashed on me when I tried to add the book my sister was reading on the flight to London.”
